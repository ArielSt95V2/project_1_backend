```
Please follow the token limits provided in square brackets for each section to maintain clarity and conciseness.


1. Start with a brief overview of the entire file: Provide a concise summary of the overall purpose of the file and its role in the system. include the technology stack, key libraries and frameworks used (e.g., Django, Flask, etc.) and its main functionality.
[100-130 tokens]

2. For each main component (class, model, function), follow these steps:

- Name and Purpose: Start with the name of the component and describe its role in the file and how it contributes to the file's overall functionality.
[40-55 tokens]

- Key Attributes and Fields: List and briefly describe the main attributes (e.g., fields, parameters, methods) of the component. For functions, explain the parameters and return values. For models, describe the fields and their types.
[55-65 tokens]

- Input/Output: Describe the input the component expects (data formats, arguments) and what output or result it generates (e.g., database entries, processed data, API responses).
[40-55 tokens]

- Outline the Key Algorithm and Logic Flow: Summarize the main logic of the component, including major operations like loops, conditionals, and recursion. Describe how the data moves through the component, outlining key steps in decision-making and interaction with other parts of the system (e.g., APIs, databases).
[55-65 tokens]

- Describe Data Structures: Highlight the key data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, models) used in the code. Explain their roles, how they are initialized or manipulated, and how they contribute to the overall function of the component. Include any significant operations performed on these structures.
[40-55 tokens]

- Error Handling: Describe how the component manages errors or unexpected input. Mention any exceptions, edge case handling, and retry mechanisms.
[40-55 tokens]

- Environment/Configuration Setups: Specify any necessary environment or configuration setups, such as environment variables, configuration files, or containerization details, required for the component to run properly.
[40-55 tokens]

- Key Dependencies: List any important libraries, APIs, or frameworks the code relies on, and explain their role in the file.
[25-40 tokens]

- Representative Code Snippets: Include a short code snippet only if necessary to clarify complex or critical logic.
[40-55 tokens]

- Final Remarks: Conclude with any final thoughts on the component, including limitations, potential improvements, or suggestions for future extensions.
[40-55 tokens]

3. Provide final remarks for the entire file: Offer concluding insights on the overall role of the file within the larger system, potential improvements, or any specific considerations for future upgrades.
