STEP 1 
models.py
This models.py file defines a ChatHistory model for a Django application, used to store chat messages between users and an assistant. The model consists of four fields: user, which is a foreign key linking to the AUTH_USER_MODEL (associating each message with a user); message, a text field storing the content of the chat; timestamp, a DateTimeField that automatically logs when a message was created; and role, a CharField indicating whether the message was sent by the 'user' or the 'assistant', with predefined choices for these roles. The model also includes a __str__() method that returns a string representation of each chat message in the format "[role] user email at timestamp". This helps when viewing entries in Django’s admin panel. The code depends on Django’s ORM and settings to manage the user relationship.

Example:

ChatHistory.objects.create(user=request.user, message="Hello, how can I assist you?", role="assistant")

STEP 2

_____________________________________________________________________________


serializers.py 

This code defines a ChatHistorySerializer using Django REST Framework to serialize and deserialize data for the ChatHistory model. The ChatHistorySerializer inherits from serializers.ModelSerializer, providing an efficient way to convert the ChatHistory model instances to and from formats like JSON. The Meta class specifies that the serializer is tied to the ChatHistory model and defines the fields to be included: id, message, timestamp, and role. Additionally, the read_only_fields option ensures that certain fields—id, timestamp, and role—cannot be modified during serialization and are automatically generated or provided by the system. This ensures that the id is auto-incremented, the timestamp is auto-set upon creation, and the role is predefined by the system.

Example:

serializer = ChatHistorySerializer(data={'message': 'Hello, how can I help?'})
if serializer.is_valid():
    serializer.save(user=request.user, role='assistant')

views.py

This views.py file defines two views for managing chat history and handling real-time chat interactions using Django REST Framework and the OpenAI API. The first view, ChatHistoryListCreateView, is a ListCreateAPIView that allows authenticated users to view their chat history and create new chat messages. The queryset filters chat messages based on the currently authenticated user, ordering them by timestamp. When a new chat message is created, the perform_create method automatically associates the message with the logged-in user.

The second view, ChatMessageView, is an APIView that processes user messages and interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses. When a user sends a message via a POST request, it is saved in the ChatHistory with the role of 'user'. The view then sends this message to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model, which generates a response. The assistant’s message is saved with the role 'assistant', and the response is returned to the user. If any error occurs during the API call, the view catches and logs the exception, returning an error message.


Example:

POST /api/chat/message
{
    "message": "What is the weather like?"
}

urls.py

This urls.py file defines URL patterns for the chat application, connecting the views from views.py to specific API endpoints. It uses Django's path function to map the following views:

ChatHistoryListCreateView: This view is connected to the /history/ endpoint, allowing users to retrieve and create chat history. When a user accesses this URL, the view handles GET requests to display the chat history and POST requests to create new chat messages. The URL is named chat-history for easy reference.

ChatMessageView: This view is mapped to the /message/ endpoint, which handles POST requests to allow users to send messages and receive AI-generated replies. The view integrates with OpenAI's API to generate a response and saves both user and assistant messages in the database. The URL is named chat-message.


Example:

GET /api/chat/history/      # Retrieve chat history
POST /api/chat/message/     # Send a message and receive AI response
